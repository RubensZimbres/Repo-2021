Check the following items:
 - The IAP firewall rule is valid.
 - IAP tunneling is enabled.
 - You are connecting using an IAP token.
 - You have the IAM role of Project Owner, IAP-Secured Tunnel User, or iap.tunnelInstances.accessViaIAP (preferred)
 - Your organization hasn't blocked access to external IP addresses. IAP changes the source traffic to 35.235.240.0/20 and the tunnel to https://tunnel.cloudproxy.app.
 - If your organization blocks access to public IP addresses, try connecting through a bastion server.
