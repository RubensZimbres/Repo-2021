We will use a PPA for adding Pipewire to Ubuntu 20.04, which is maintained regularly:
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipewire-debian/pipewire-upstream

To update the PPA packages in your system do:
    sudo apt update
    
Install the package
    sudo apt install pipewire

There is also a dependency needed to be installed with pipewire otherwise you will face the issue of “Bluetooth headset won’t connect after installing pipewire” . Install the dependency by:
    sudo apt install libspa-0.2-bluetooth

Now, To install the client libraries.
    sudo apt install pipewire-audio-client-libraries

Reload the Daemon
    systemctl — user daemon-reload

Disable Pulseaudio
    systemctl — user — now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket

Enable Pipewire
    systemctl — user — now enable pipewire pipewire-pulse

If you are on Ubuntu 20.04, you also need to “mask” the Pulseaudio by
    systemctl — user mask pulseaudio

I am not sure but if possible you can run this on other versions too.

After a new update, you also need to enable pipewire-media-session-service
    systemctl — user — now enable pipewire-media-session.service

You can ensure that Pipewire is now running through:
    pactl info
